					    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1. Why do we need hypothesis testing?
					    <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;2. Understanding hypothesis testing
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;3. Problem on hypothesis testing

            <br><p class="use-noteworthy-font"><mark>1. Why do we need hypothesis testing?</mark></p>
            <p class="use-noteworthy-font">
              In the real world we do a lot of observations or experiments and we would like to validate those experiments.
              <br>For example: 
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;-whether the new drug is better than the previous one.
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;-whether the drug had an impact on the growth rate of a population.
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;-whether the new refrigerator significantly reduces the power consumption	
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;-whether market sentiment increased after the new budget announcement.
            </p>



            <br><p class="use-noteworthy-font"><mark>2. Understanding hypothesis testing</mark></p>
            <p class="use-noteworthy-font">
              Let's take an example to understand hypothesis testing more intuitively: Apple has released a new 
			version of the app. They have 2 distributions of user's-spend-time, corresponding to old and new versions 
			respectively. They want to know whether a new version made any significant improvement over the user's 
			spend time.
            <br> We will try to understand this problem in 5 steps:
            </p>
            <p class="use-noteworthy-font">
              step1: Following diagram shows the distribution for user spend time on both the versions of the app 
				individually.
            </p>
            <img src="../blogs_images/blog_2_step_1.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            <p class="use-noteworthy-font">
              As you can see there are 2 distributions 
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a) Version 1.0 user-spend-time distribution with mean = µ0  
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;b) Version 2.0 user-spend-time distribution with mean = µ1
            </p>



            <p class="use-noteworthy-font">
              <br><br>Step2: From the problem statement we can understand that we want to see whether there is a 
              significant improvement in the mean users-spend-time in the latest version.  From this we already know that µ1 > µ0  but whether this improvement is significant or fluke 
              is the question that we want to address. 
            </p>

            <p class="use-noteworthy-font">
              <br><br>Step3:  Lets plot version 2.0 mean on version 1.0 distribution. It could be anywhere above µ0  but lets 
              randomly select a place to plot it, which helps us to understand further concepts better
            </p>
            <img src="../blogs_images/blog_2_step3.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            <p class="use-noteworthy-font">
              What does the above diagram or distribution implies?
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- We are trying to see where exactly the mean of version 2 is situated in version 1 distribution.
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- To put it in another words what is the probability of seeing µ1 in version 1.0 distribution
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Mathematically
              <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;P(x==µ1 in version 1.0 distribution)
    
            <br>As we can remember normal distributions are continuous distributions.. Probability at any point 
            in normal distribution is always 0. So, instead of finding the probability of seeing µ1 in version 1 distribution as follows:
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; P( x==µ1 in version 1.0 distribution) 
            <br>we can find the probability of seeing µ1 or any greater value in version 1 distribution: 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;P( x>=µ1 in version 1.0 distribution)
            <br>Why x>=µ1  ? To answer this question let's have a look at the above distribution. If µ1 is a significant 
				improvement then anything above that would also make it a significant improvement too right? 
    
            Hence, we are looking at this area:
            </p>
            <img src="../blogs_images/blog_2_step_3_2.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">



            <p class="use-noteworthy-font">
              <br><br>Step4: We already know that the area under probability distribution is 1. In the version 1 distribution 
              we really don't know where exactly µ1 is situated.
            </p>
            <img src="../blogs_images/blog_2_step_4.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">

            <p class="use-noteworthy-font">
            <u>What it implies version 2 mean i.e µ1 being very close to version 1 mean i.e µ0 in version 1 distribution ?</u>
            <br>Ans: It says the probability of seeing x>=µ1 in version 1 distribution is very high. 
				    In other words the if area under normal distribution corresponding to x=>µ1 is more then there 
				    is no significant change or difference
				   Hence, version 2 is not a significant improvement over version 1  

           <br><br><u>What it implies version 2 mean i.e µ1 being very far from version 1 mean i.e µ0 in version 1 distribution ?</u>
			     <br>Ans: Mathematically it says the probability of seeing x>=µ1 in version 1 distribution is very low. 
				    In other words the if area under normal distribution corresponding to x=>µ1 is less then there 
				    is a significant change or difference
				   Hence, version 2 is a significant improvement over version 1 
            </p>



            <p class="use-noteworthy-font">
              <br><br>Step5:  How do we know whether the area is more or less ? 
              <br>For this we need a threshold. This threshold is usually called as significance value. 
              <br>if area under normal distribution corresponding to x=>µ1 is more than threshold area we can say 
               version 2 is not a significant improvement over version 1 
               <br>else area under normal distribution corresponding to x=>µ1 is less than threshold area we can say
              version 2 is a significant improvement over version 1

            <br><p class="use-noteworthy-font"><mark>3. Problem on hypothesis testing</mark></p>
            <br><p class="use-noteworthy-font"><u><b>Prerequisite alert:</b></u> Following problem requires Understanding of "features of distributions like mean, median, mode, range, z-score, variance, 
              standard deviation etc.." If you are not familiar with these please take a look at this blog - <a href="https://dharmanathpatil.com/blogs/blog_2a.html" target="_blank" >Features of any distribution</a></p>
            <p class="use-noteworthy-font">Example Problem: A teacher claims that the mean score of students in his class is greater than 82 
              with a standard deviation of 20. If a sample of 81 students was selected with a mean score 
              of 90 then check if there is enough evidence to support this claim at a 0.05 significance level.</p>

              <p class="use-noteworthy-font">Solution: This is one tailed test. Since teacher is interested in whether observed mean is grater than
                population mean</p>

                <p class="use-noteworthy-font">					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Null Hypothesis : Population mean = Sample mean
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Alt Hypothesis:   Population mean &lt; Sample mean
                  <br>
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;population statistics:  μ=82  σ=20   
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;sample statistics:      μm=82   n=81        
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;significance level:      α=0.05

                  <br>
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Calculating z-score:  z = (x – μ) / (σ / √n)
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;   = ( 90-82) / ( 20/√81)
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;   z-score=3.6
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hence observed mean is 3.6 standard error of mean above population mean

                  <br>
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Calculating p-value: We want to calculate the area under normal distribution which 
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;is above 3.6 SD away from mean
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;   p-value = Total area above mean - Total area till 3.6 SD above mean
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;    = 0.50 - ztable(3.6)
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;     = 0.50 - 0.4998
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;   p-value =  0.0002
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hence p(x>= μm | Null hypothesis is true )  or p-value is 0.0002

                  <br>
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Conclusion:
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Since significance level or  α > p-value we can reject null hypothesis
                  <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hence there is a significant improvement in the mean of score
